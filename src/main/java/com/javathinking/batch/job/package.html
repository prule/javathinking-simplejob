<h1>Job</h1>

<p>
    'Job' is a small package to aid in batch processing.
    It aims to be simple and effective, but its simplicity may not be appropriate
    for all projects.
</p>

<h3>Basic concepts</h3>

<p>
    Monitors are used to watch a resource - such as a directory or a database.
</p>

<p>
    Tasks perform processing based on the inputs provided by a monitor. This is where the application
    business logic gets invoked.
</p>

<p>A monitor and collection of tasks can be run using the TaskManager - by providing a sleep period,
    a monitor, and a list of tasks.
<ol>
    <li>A thread is created which polls the monitor at the specified interval.</li>
    <li>If the monitor returns items for processing, each task in the list is invoked in turn</li>
    <li>If a task returns false, then processing is aborted and the remaining tasks are not run</li>
    <li>The thread then sleeps for the specified period</li>
</ol>
The tasks are responsible for 'consuming' the items found by the monitors - otherwise they will be
processed again, the next time the monitor polls.
</p>
<p>
    Job comes with a Queue concept. This allows tasks to put entries on the queue, to be read
    by a QueueMonitor (which would be associated with other tasks). This way, events can be queued for
    consumption later. Thus if the system is shut down part way through processing, when it is restarted
    processing will begin again.
</p>

<p>
    The queue supports a discriminator so that if the monitor need to distinguish between various
    types of queue entries, they can.
</p>

<p>
    A sample application illustrating how these concepts come together into an application is available
    in the com.javathinking.batch.example package.
</p>

<p>
    An obvious drawback from the simplicity of this solution is that it is based on polling - a logical
    evolution from this point would be to introduce messaging to remove the polling and have a more
    responsive system.
