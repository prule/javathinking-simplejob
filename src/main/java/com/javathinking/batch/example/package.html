<h1>Simple Job Example</h1>

<p>
    In this example, we assume there are multiple partners ("1" and "2") providing data for consumption.
    This data arrives as files, placed in particular directories ("/tmp/test/1" and "/tmp/test/2").
</p>

<p>
    We use conventions and programmatic instantiation of the monitors and tasks so we can simply define
    a new partner and not have to change any other code.
</p>

<p>
    When a file is received, we want to archive it, then validate it. Because the partner data is
    independent, different partner data can be processed in parallel, but within a particular partner
    we need to process files in the order they came.
</p>

<p>
    For each partner:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a DirectoryMonitor that watches their designated directory.</li>
    <li>Create a FileReceiveTask to:
        <ol>
            <li>archive the file</li>
            <li>add a FILE_RX message to the queue - the queue message is created using the partner name as the discriminator so that a QueueMonitor
                can be created per partner.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Create a FileValidateTask to:
        <ol>
            <li>Check the file name</li>
            <li>Check the file extension</li>
            <li>Check the zip structure is what we expect</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Create an UnzipTask to unzip the file after successful validation</li>
    <li>Create a ShipOrderProcessorTask to validate the unzipped files
        <ol>
            <li>Check the schema</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
